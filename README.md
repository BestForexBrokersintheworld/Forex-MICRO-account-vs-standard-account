## Forex Micro Account vs Standard Account: Key Differences

### 1. **Lot Size and Trade Volume**
The most significant difference between a **micro account** and a **standard account** is the lot size:
- **Micro Account:** 1,000 units (micro lots)
- **Standard Account:** 100,000 units (standard lots)

With a micro account, you can trade smaller positions, which lowers your exposure. In contrast, standard accounts allow traders to take larger positions, which can lead to higher profits but also increases the potential for larger losses.

### 2. **Minimum Deposit**
- **Micro Account:** Typically requires a much smaller initial deposit, often as low as $1 to $50. This makes it ideal for beginners with limited capital.
- **Standard Account:** Requires a higher minimum deposit, usually between $100 and $500, which is suited for traders who have more capital to risk.

### 3. **Risk and Leverage**
- **Micro Account:** The risk is much lower due to smaller trade sizes, which is perfect for **novice traders** or those wanting to practice their trading skills. Leverage tends to be higher, allowing traders to control more significant positions with less capital.
- **Standard Account:** Standard accounts have a higher risk factor, with larger trades and lower leverage. This suits more experienced traders who are comfortable with risk and managing larger capital.

### 4. **Spreads and Commissions**
- **Micro Account:** Spreads tend to be **wider**, and commissions may be higher in some cases. This is due to the smaller position sizes and the higher risk associated with the account.
- **Standard Account:** Spreads are generally **tighter**, and commissions may be lower. Traders benefit from more competitive trading conditions.

### 5. **Suitability**
- **Micro Account:** Best for beginners, people testing strategies, or traders who want to minimize their risk.
- **Standard Account:** More suitable for intermediate to advanced traders looking to trade larger lots and higher profits.
